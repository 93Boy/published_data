  abstract = "European population history has been shaped by migrations of
              people, and their subsequent admixture. Recently, ancient DNA has
              brought new insights into European migration events linked to the
              advent of agriculture, and possibly to the spread of
              Indo-European languages. However, little is known about the
              ancient population history of north-eastern Europe, in particular
              about populations speaking Uralic languages, such as Finns and
              Saami. Here we analyse ancient genomic data from 11 individuals
              from Finland and north-western Russia. We show that the genetic
              makeup of northern Europe was shaped by migrations from Siberia
              that began at least 3500 years ago. This Siberian ancestry was
              subsequently admixed into many modern populations in the region,
              particularly into populations speaking Uralic languages today.
              Additionally, we show that ancestors of modern Saami inhabited a
              larger territory during the Iron Age, which adds to the
              historical and linguistic information about the population
              history of Finland.",
