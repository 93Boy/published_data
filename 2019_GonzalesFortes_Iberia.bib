  abstract = "Being at the western fringe of Europe, Iberia had a peculiar
              prehistory and a complex pattern of Neolithization. A few
              studies, all based on modern populations, reported the presence
              of DNA of likely African origin in this region, generally
              concluding it was the result of recent gene flow, probably during
              the Islamic period. Here, we provide evidence of much older gene
              flow from Africa to Iberia by sequencing whole genomes from four
              human remains from northern Portugal and southern Spain dated
              around 4000 years BP (from the Middle Neolithic to the Bronze
              Age). We found one of them to carry an unequivocal sub-Saharan
              mitogenome of most probably West or West-Central African origin,
              to our knowledge never reported before in prehistoric remains
              outside Africa. Our analyses of ancient nuclear genomes show
              small but significant levels of sub-Saharan African affinity in
              several ancient Iberian samples, which indicates that what we
              detected was not an occasional individual phenomenon, but an
              admixture event recognizable at the population level. We
              interpret this result as evidence of an early migration process
              from Africa into the Iberian Peninsula through a western route,
              possibly across the Strait of Gibraltar.",
