  abstract = "During the Final Eneolithic the Corded Ware Complex (CWC)
              emerges, chiefly identified by its specific burial rites. This
              complex spanned most of central Europe and exhibits demographic
              and cultural associations to the Yamnaya culture. To study the
              genetic structure and kin relations in CWC communities, we
              sequenced the genomes of 19 individuals located in the heartland
              of the CWC complex region, south-eastern Poland. Whole genome
              sequence and strontium isotope data allowed us to investigate
              genetic ancestry, admixture, kinship and mobility. The analysis
              showed a unique pattern, not detected in other parts of Poland;
              maternally the individuals are linked to earlier Neolithic
              lineages, whereas on the paternal side a Steppe ancestry is
              clearly visible. We identified three cases of kinship. Of these
              two were between individuals buried in double graves.
              Interestingly, we identified kinship between a local and a
              non-local individual thus discovering a novel, previously unknown
              burial custom.",
