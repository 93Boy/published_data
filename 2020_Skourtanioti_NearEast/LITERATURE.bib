  abstract = "Here, we report genome-wide data analyses from 110 ancient Near
              Eastern individuals spanning the Late Neolithic to Late Bronze
              Age, a period characterized by intense interregional interactions
              for the Near East. We find that 6th millennium BCE populations of
              North/Central Anatolia and the Southern Caucasus shared mixed
              ancestry on a genetic cline that formed during the Neolithic
              between Western Anatolia and regions in today's Southern
              Caucasus/Zagros. During the Late Chalcolithic and/or the Early
              Bronze Age, more than half of the Northern Levantine gene pool
              was replaced, while in the rest of Anatolia and the Southern
              Caucasus, we document genetic continuity with only transient gene
              flow. Additionally, we reveal a genetically distinct individual
              within the Late Bronze Age Northern Levant. Overall, our study
              uncovers multiple scales of population dynamics through time,
              from extensive admixture during the Neolithic period to
              long-distance mobility within the globalized societies of the
              Late Bronze Age. VIDEO ABSTRACT.",
