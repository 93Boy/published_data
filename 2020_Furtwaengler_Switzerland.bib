  abstract = "Genetic studies of Neolithic and Bronze Age skeletons from Europe
              have provided evidence for strong population genetic changes at
              the beginning and the end of the Neolithic period. To further
              understand the implications of these in Southern Central Europe,
              we analyze 96 ancient genomes from Switzerland, Southern Germany,
              and the Alsace region in France, covering the Middle/Late
              Neolithic to Early Bronze Age. Similar to previously described
              genetic changes in other parts of Europe from the early 3rd
              millennium BCE, we detect an arrival of ancestry related to Late
              Neolithic pastoralists from the Pontic-Caspian steppe in
              Switzerland as early as 2860-2460 calBCE. Our analyses suggest
              that this genetic turnover was a complex process lasting almost
              1000 years and involved highly genetically structured populations
              in this region.",
