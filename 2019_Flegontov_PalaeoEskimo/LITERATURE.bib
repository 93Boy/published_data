  abstract = "Much of the American Arctic was first settled 5,000 years ago, by
              groups of people known as Palaeo-Eskimos. They were subsequently
              joined and largely displaced around 1,000 years ago by ancestors
              of the present-day Inuit and Yup'ik1-3. The genetic relationship
              between Palaeo-Eskimos and Native American, Inuit, Yup'ik and
              Aleut populations remains uncertain4-6. Here we present genomic
              data for 48 ancient individuals from Chukotka, East Siberia, the
              Aleutian Islands, Alaska, and the Canadian Arctic. We co-analyse
              these data with data from present-day Alaskan I{\~n}upiat and
              West Siberian populations and published genomes. Using methods
              based on rare-allele and haplotype sharing, as well as
              established techniques4,7-9, we show that Palaeo-Eskimo-related
              ancestry is ubiquitous among people who speak Na-Dene and
              Eskimo-Aleut languages. We develop a comprehensive model for the
              Holocene peopling events of Chukotka and North America, and show
              that Na-Dene-speaking peoples, people of the Aleutian Islands,
              and Yup'ik and Inuit across the Arctic region all share ancestry
              from a single Palaeo-Eskimo-related Siberian source.",
