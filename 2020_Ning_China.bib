   abstract = "Northern China harbored the world's earliest complex societies
               based on millet farming, in two major centers in the Yellow (YR)
               and West Liao (WLR) River basins. Until now, their genetic
               histories have remained largely unknown. Here we present 55
               ancient genomes dating to 7500-1700 BP from the YR, WLR, and Amur
               River (AR) regions. Contrary to the genetic stability in the AR,
               the YR and WLR genetic profiles substantially changed over time.
               The YR populations show a monotonic increase over time in their
               genetic affinity with present-day southern Chinese and Southeast
               Asians. In the WLR, intensification of farming in the Late
               Neolithic is correlated with increased YR affinity while the
               inclusion of a pastoral economy in the Bronze Age was correlated
               with increased AR affinity. Our results suggest a link between
               changes in subsistence strategy and human migration, and fuel the
               debate about archaeolinguistic signatures of past human
               migration.",
