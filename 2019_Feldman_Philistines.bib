  abstract = "The ancient Mediterranean port city of Ashkelon, identified as
              ``Philistine'' during the Iron Age, underwent a marked cultural
              change between the Late Bronze and the early Iron Age. It has
              been long debated whether this change was driven by a substantial
              movement of people, possibly linked to a larger migration of the
              so-called ``Sea Peoples.'' Here, we report genome-wide data of 10
              Bronze and Iron Age individuals from Ashkelon. We find that the
              early Iron Age population was genetically distinct due to a
              European-related admixture. This genetic signal is no longer
              detectible in the later Iron Age population. Our results support
              that a migration event occurred during the Bronze to Iron Age
              transition in Ashkelon but did not leave a long-lasting genetic
              signature.",
