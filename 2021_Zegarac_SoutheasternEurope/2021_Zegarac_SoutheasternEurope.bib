  abstract = "Twenty-four palaeogenomes from Mokrin, a major Early Bronze Age
              necropolis in southeastern Europe, were sequenced to analyse
              kinship between individuals and to better understand prehistoric
              social organization. 15 investigated individuals were involved in
              genetic relationships of varying degrees. The Mokrin sample
              resembles a genetically unstructured population, suggesting that
              the community's social hierarchies were not accompanied by strict
              marriage barriers. We find evidence for female exogamy but no
              indications for strict patrilocality. Individual status
              differences at Mokrin, as indicated by grave goods, support the
              inference that females could inherit status, but could not
              transmit status to all their sons. We further show that sons had
              the possibility to acquire status during their lifetimes, but not
              necessarily to inherit it. Taken together, these findings suggest
              that Southeastern Europe in the Early Bronze Age had a
              significantly different family and social structure than Late
              Neolithic and Early Bronze Age societies of Central Europe.",
