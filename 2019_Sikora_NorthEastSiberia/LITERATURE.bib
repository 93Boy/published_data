  abstract = "Northeastern Siberia has been inhabited by humans for more than
              40,000 years but its deep population history remains poorly
              understood. Here we investigate the late Pleistocene population
              history of northeastern Siberia through analyses of 34 newly
              recovered ancient genomes that date to between 31,000 and 600
              years ago. We document complex population dynamics during this
              period, including at least three major migration events: an
              initial peopling by a previously unknown Palaeolithic population
              of 'Ancient North Siberians' who are distantly related to early
              West Eurasian hunter-gatherers; the arrival of East Asian-related
              peoples, which gave rise to 'Ancient Palaeo-Siberians' who are
              closely related to contemporary communities from far-northeastern
              Siberia (such as the Koryaks), as well as Native Americans; and a
              Holocene migration of other East Asian-related peoples, who we
              name 'Neo-Siberians', and from whom many contemporary Siberians
              are descended. Each of these population expansions largely
              replaced the earlier inhabitants, and ultimately generated the
              mosaic genetic make-up of contemporary peoples who inhabit a vast
              area across northern Eurasia and the Americas.",
