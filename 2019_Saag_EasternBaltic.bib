  abstract = "In this study, we compare the genetic ancestry of individuals
              from two as yet genetically unstudied cultural traditions in
              Estonia in the context of available modern and ancient datasets:
              15 from the Late Bronze Age stone-cist graves (1200-400 BC)
              (EstBA) and 6 from the Pre-Roman Iron Age tarand cemeteries
              (800/500 BC-50 AD) (EstIA). We also included 5 Pre-Roman to Roman
              Iron Age Ingrian (500 BC-450 AD) (IngIA) and 7 Middle Age
              Estonian (1200-1600 AD) (EstMA) individuals to build a dataset
              for studying the demographic history of the northern parts of the
              Eastern Baltic from the earliest layer of Mesolithic to modern
              times. Our findings are consistent with EstBA receiving gene flow
              from regions with strong Western hunter-gatherer (WHG) affinities
              and EstIA from populations related to modern Siberians. The
              latter inference is in accordance with Y chromosome (chrY)
              distributions in present day populations of the Eastern Baltic,
              as well as patterns of autosomal variation in the majority of the
              westernmost Uralic speakers [1-5]. This ancestry reached the
              coasts of the Baltic Sea no later than the mid-first millennium
              BC; i.e., in the same time window as the diversification of west
              Uralic (Finnic) languages [6]. Furthermore, phenotypic traits
              often associated with modern Northern Europeans, like light eyes,
              hair, and skin, as well as lactose tolerance, can be traced back
              to the Bronze Age in the Eastern Baltic. VIDEO ABSTRACT.",
