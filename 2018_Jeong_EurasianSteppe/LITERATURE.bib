  abstract = "Recent paleogenomic studies have shown that migrations of Western
              steppe herders (WSH) beginning in the Eneolithic (ca. 3300-2700
              BCE) profoundly transformed the genes and cultures of Europe and
              central Asia. Compared with Europe, however, the eastern extent
              of this WSH expansion is not well defined. Here we present
              genomic and proteomic data from 22 directly dated Late Bronze Age
              burials putatively associated with early pastoralism in northern
              Mongolia (ca. 1380-975 BCE). Genome-wide analysis reveals that
              they are largely descended from a population represented by Early
              Bronze Age hunter-gatherers in the Baikal region, with only a
              limited contribution (âˆ¼7\%) of WSH ancestry. At the same time,
              however, mass spectrometry analysis of dental calculus provides
              direct protein evidence of bovine, sheep, and goat milk
              consumption in seven of nine individuals. No individuals showed
              molecular evidence of lactase persistence, and only one
              individual exhibited evidence of >10\% WSH ancestry, despite the
              presence of WSH populations in the nearby Altai-Sayan region for
              more than a millennium. Unlike the spread of Neolithic farming in
              Europe and the expansion of Bronze Age pastoralism on the Western
              steppe, our results indicate that ruminant dairy pastoralism was
              adopted on the Eastern steppe by local hunter-gatherers through a
              process of cultural transmission and minimal genetic exchange
              with outside groups.",
