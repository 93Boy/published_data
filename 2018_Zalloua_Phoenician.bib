  abstract = "Ibiza was permanently settled around the 7th century BCE by
              founders arriving from west Phoenicia. The founding population
              grew significantly and reached its height during the 4th century
              BCE. We obtained nine complete mitochondrial genomes from
              skeletal remains from two Punic necropoli in Ibiza and a Bronze
              Age site from Formentara. We also obtained low coverage (0.47X
              average depth) of the genome of one individual, directly dated to
              361-178 cal BCE, from the Cas Mol{\'\i} site on Ibiza. We
              analysed and compared ancient DNA results with 18 new
              mitochondrial genomes from modern Ibizans to determine the
              ancestry of the founders of Ibiza. The mitochondrial results
              indicate a predominantly recent European maternal ancestry for
              the current Ibizan population while the whole genome data suggest
              a significant Eastern Mediterranean component. Our mitochondrial
              results suggest a genetic discontinuity between the early
              Phoenician settlers and the island's modern inhabitants. Our
              data, while limited, suggest that the Eastern or North African
              influence in the Punic population of Ibiza was primarily male
              dominated.",
