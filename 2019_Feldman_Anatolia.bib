  abstract = "Anatolia was home to some of the earliest farming communities. It
              has been long debated whether a migration of farming groups
              introduced agriculture to central Anatolia. Here, we report the
              first genome-wide data from a 15,000-year-old Anatolian
              hunter-gatherer and from seven Anatolian and Levantine early
              farmers. We find high genetic continuity (~80-90\%) between the
              hunter-gatherers and early farmers of Anatolia and detect two
              distinct incoming ancestries: an early Iranian/Caucasus related
              one and a later one linked to the ancient Levant. Finally, we
              observe a genetic link between southern Europe and the Near East
              predating 15,000 years ago. Our results suggest a limited role of
              human migration in the emergence of agriculture in central
              Anatolia.",
