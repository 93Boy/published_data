  abstract = "Starting from 12,000 years ago in the Middle East, the Neolithic
              lifestyle spread across Europe via separate continental and
              Mediterranean routes. Genomes from early European farmers have
              shown a clear Near Eastern/Anatolian genetic affinity with
              limited contribution from hunter-gatherers. However, no genomic
              data are available from modern-day France, where both routes
              converged, as evidenced by a mosaic cultural pattern. Here, we
              present genome-wide data from 101 individuals from 12 sites
              covering today's France and Germany from the Mesolithic (N = 3)
              to the Neolithic (N = 98) (7000-3000 BCE). Using the genetic
              substructure observed in European hunter-gatherers, we
              characterize diverse patterns of admixture in different regions,
              consistent with both routes of expansion. Early western European
              farmers show a higher proportion of distinctly western
              hunter-gatherer ancestry compared to central/southeastern
              farmers. Our data highlight the complexity of the biological
              interactions during the Neolithic expansion by revealing major
              regional variations.",
