  abstract = "Revealing and understanding the mechanisms behind social
              inequality in prehistoric societies is a major challenge. By
              combining genome-wide data, isotopic evidence, and
              anthropological and archaeological data, we have gone beyond the
              dominating supraregional approaches in archaeogenetics to shed
              light on the complexity of social status, inheritance rules, and
              mobility during the Bronze Age. We applied a deep microregional
              approach and analyzed genome-wide data of 104 human individuals
              deriving from farmstead-related cemeteries from the Late
              Neolithic to the Middle Bronze Age in southern Germany. Our
              results reveal individual households, lasting several
              generations, that consisted of a high-status core family and
              unrelated low-status individuals; a social organization
              accompanied by patrilocality and female exogamy; and the
              stability of this system over 700 years.",
