  abstract = "We report genome-wide ancient DNA from 49 individuals forming
              four parallel time transects in Belize, Brazil, the Central
              Andes, and the Southern Cone, each dating to at least ∼9,000
              years ago. The common ancestral population radiated rapidly from
              just one of the two early branches that contributed to Native
              Americans today. We document two previously unappreciated streams
              of gene flow between North and South America. One affected the
              Central Andes by ∼4,200 years ago, while the other explains an
              affinity between the oldest North American genome associated with
              the Clovis culture and the oldest Central and South Americans
              from Chile, Brazil, and Belize. However, this was not the primary
              source for later South Americans, as the other ancient
              individuals derive from lineages without specific affinity to the
              Clovis-associated genome, suggesting a population replacement
              that began at least 9,000 years ago and was followed by
              substantial population continuity in multiple regions.",
