  abstract = "The Cucuteni-Trypillia complex (CTC) flourished in eastern Europe
              for over two millennia (5100-2800 BCE) from the end of the
              Neolithic to the Early Bronze Age. Its vast distribution area
              encompassed modern-day eastern Romania, Moldova and
              western/central Ukraine. Due to a lack of existing burials
              throughout most of this time, only little is known about the
              people associated with this complex and their genetic
              composition. Here, we present genome-wide data generated from the
              skeletal remains of four females that were excavated from two
              Late CTC sites in Moldova (3500-3100 BCE). All individuals
              carried a large Neolithic-derived ancestry component and were
              genetically more closely related to Linear Pottery than to
              Anatolian farmers. Three of the specimens also showed
              considerable amounts of steppe-related ancestry, suggesting
              influx into the CTC gene-pool from people affiliated with, for
              instance, the Ukraine Mesolithic. The latter scenario is
              supported by archaeological evidence. Taken together, our results
              confirm that the steppe component arrived in eastern Europe
              farming communities maybe as early as 3500 BCE. In addition, they
              are in agreement with the hypothesis of ongoing contacts and
              gradual admixture between incoming steppe and local western
              populations.",
