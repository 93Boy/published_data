  abstract = "Recent studies of early Bronze Age human genomes revealed a
              massive population expansion by individuals-related to the
              Yamnaya culture, from the Pontic Caspian steppe into Western and
              Eastern Eurasia, likely accompanied by the spread of
              Indo-European languages [1-5]. The south eastern extent of this
              migration is currently not known. Modern-day human populations
              from the Xinjiang region in northwestern China show a complex
              population history, with genetic links to both Eastern and
              Western Eurasia [6-10]. However, due to the lack of ancient
              genomic data, it remains unclear which source populations
              contributed to the Xinjiang population and what was the timing
              and the number of admixture events. Here, we report the first
              genome-wide data of 10 ancient individuals from northeastern
              Xinjiang. They are dated to around 2,200 years ago and were found
              at the Iron Age Shirenzigou site. We find them to be already
              genetically admixed between Eastern and Western Eurasians. We
              also find that the majority of the East Eurasian ancestry in the
              Shirenzigou individuals is-related to northeastern Asian
              populations, while the West Eurasian ancestry is best presented
              by âˆ¼20\% to 80\% Yamnaya-like ancestry. Our data thus suggest a
              Western Eurasian steppe origin for at least part of the ancient
              Xinjiang population. Our findings furthermore support a
              Yamnaya-related origin for the now extinct Tocharian languages in
              the Tarim Basin, in southern Xinjiang.",
