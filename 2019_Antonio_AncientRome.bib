  abstract = "Ancient Rome was the capital of an empire of ~70 million
              inhabitants, but little is known about the genetics of ancient
              Romans. Here we present 127 genomes from 29 archaeological sites
              in and around Rome, spanning the past 12,000 years. We observe
              two major prehistoric ancestry transitions: one with the
              introduction of farming and another prior to the Iron Age. By the
              founding of Rome, the genetic composition of the region
              approximated that of modern Mediterranean populations. During the
              Imperial period, Rome's population received net immigration from
              the Near East, followed by an increase in genetic contributions
              from Europe. These ancestry shifts mirrored the geopolitical
              affiliations of Rome and were accompanied by marked
              interindividual diversity, reflecting gene flow from across the
              Mediterranean, Europe, and North Africa.",
