  abstract = "Situated at over 5,000 meters above sea level in the Himalayan
              Mountains, Roopkund Lake is home to the scattered skeletal
              remains of several hundred individuals of unknown origin. We
              report genome-wide ancient DNA for 38 skeletons from Roopkund
              Lake, and find that they cluster into three distinct groups. A
              group of 23 individuals have ancestry that falls within the range
              of variation of present-day South Asians. A further 14 have
              ancestry typical of the eastern Mediterranean. We also identify
              one individual with Southeast Asian-related ancestry. Radiocarbon
              dating indicates that these remains were not deposited
              simultaneously. Instead, all of the individuals with South
              Asian-related ancestry date to ~800 CE (but with evidence of
              being deposited in more than one event), while all other
              individuals date to ~1800 CE. These differences are also
              reflected in stable isotope measurements, which reveal a distinct
              dietary profile for the two main groups.",
