  abstract = "The Neolithic period is characterized by major cultural
              transformations and human migrations, with lasting effects across
              Europe. To understand the population dynamics in Neolithic
              Scandinavia and the Baltic Sea area, we investigate the genomes
              of individuals associated with the Battle Axe Culture (BAC), a
              Middle Neolithic complex in Scandinavia resembling the
              continental Corded Ware Culture (CWC). We sequenced 11
              individuals (dated to 3330-1665 calibrated before common era (cal
              BCE)) from modern-day Sweden, Estonia, and Poland to
              0.26-3.24$\times$ coverage. Three of the individuals were from
              CWC contexts and two from the central-Swedish BAC burial
              'Bergsgraven'. By analysing these genomes together with the
              previously published data, we show that the BAC represents a
              group different from other Neolithic populations in Scandinavia,
              revealing stratification among cultural groups. Similar to
              continental CWC, the BAC-associated individuals display ancestry
              from the Pontic-Caspian steppe herders, as well as smaller
              components originating from hunter-gatherers and Early Neolithic
              farmers. Thus, the steppe ancestry seen in these Scandinavian BAC
              individuals can be explained only by migration into Scandinavia.
              Furthermore, we highlight the reuse of megalithic tombs of the
              earlier Funnel Beaker Culture (FBC) by people related to BAC. The
              BAC groups likely mixed with resident middle Neolithic farmers
              (e.g. FBC) without substantial contributions from Neolithic
              foragers.",
