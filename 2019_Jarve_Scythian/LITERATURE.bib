  abstract = "The Early Iron Age nomadic Scythians have been described as a
              confederation of tribes of different origins, based on ancient
              DNA evidence [1-3]. It is still unclear how much of the Scythian
              dominance in the Eurasian Steppe was due to movements of people
              and how much reflected cultural diffusion and elite dominance. We
              present new whole-genome sequences of 31 ancient Western and
              Eastern Steppe individuals, including Scythians as well as
              samples pre- and postdating them, allowing us to set the
              Scythians in a temporal context (in the Western, i.e.,
              Ponto-Caspian Steppe). We detect an increase of eastern (Altaian)
              affinity along with a decrease in eastern hunter-gatherer (EHG)
              ancestry in the Early Iron Age Ponto-Caspian gene pool at the
              start of the Scythian dominance. On the other hand, samples of
              the Chernyakhiv culture postdating the Scythians in Ukraine have
              a significantly higher proportion of Near Eastern ancestry than
              other samples of this study. Our results agree with the Gothic
              source of the Chernyakhiv culture and support the hypothesis that
              the Scythian dominance did involve a demic component.",
