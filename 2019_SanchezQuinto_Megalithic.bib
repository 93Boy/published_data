  abstract = "Paleogenomic and archaeological studies show that Neolithic
              lifeways spread from the Fertile Crescent into Europe around 9000
              BCE, reaching northwestern Europe by 4000 BCE. Starting around
              4500 BCE, a new phenomenon of constructing megalithic monuments,
              particularly for funerary practices, emerged along the Atlantic
              fa{\c c}ade. While it has been suggested that the emergence of
              megaliths was associated with the territories of farming
              communities, the origin and social structure of the groups that
              erected them has remained largely unknown. We generated genome
              sequence data from human remains, corresponding to 24 individuals
              from five megalithic burial sites, encompassing the widespread
              tradition of megalithic construction in northern and western
              Europe, and analyzed our results in relation to the existing
              European paleogenomic data. The various individuals buried in
              megaliths show genetic affinities with local farming groups
              within their different chronological contexts. Individuals buried
              in megaliths display (past) admixture with local
              hunter-gatherers, similar to that seen in other Neolithic
              individuals in Europe. In relation to the tomb populations, we
              find significantly more males than females buried in the
              megaliths of the British Isles. The genetic data show close kin
              relationships among the individuals buried within the megaliths,
              and for the Irish megaliths, we found a kin relation between
              individuals buried in different megaliths. We also see paternal
              continuity through time, including the same Y-chromosome
              haplotypes reoccurring. These observations suggest that the
              investigated funerary monuments were associated with patrilineal
              kindred groups. Our genomic investigation provides insight into
              the people associated with this long-standing megalith funerary
              tradition, including their social dynamics.",
