  abstract = "We report an ancient genome from the Indus Valley Civilization
              (IVC). The individual we sequenced fits as a mixture of people
              related to ancient Iranians (the largest component) and Southeast
              Asian hunter-gatherers, a unique profile that matches ancient DNA
              from 11 genetic outliers from sites in Iran and Turkmenistan in
              cultural communication with the IVC. These individuals had little
              if any Steppe pastoralist-derived ancestry, showing that it was
              not ubiquitous in northwest South Asia during the IVC as it is
              today. The Iranian-related ancestry in the IVC derives from a
              lineage leading to early Iranian farmers, herders, and
              hunter-gatherers before their ancestors separated, contradicting
              the hypothesis that the shared ancestry between early Iranians
              and South Asians reflects a large-scale spread of western Iranian
              farmers east. Instead, sampled ancient genomes from the Iranian
              plateau and IVC descend from different groups of hunter-gatherers
              who began farming without being connected by substantial movement
              of people.",
