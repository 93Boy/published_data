  abstract = "The roles of migration, admixture and acculturation in the
              European transition to farming have been debated for over 100
              years. Genome-wide ancient DNA studies indicate predominantly
              Aegean ancestry for continental Neolithic farmers, but also
              variable admixture with local Mesolithic hunter-gatherers.
              Neolithic cultures first appear in Britain circa 4000 BC, a
              millennium after they appeared in adjacent areas of continental
              Europe. The pattern and process of this delayed British Neolithic
              transition remain unclear. We assembled genome-wide data from 6
              Mesolithic and 67 Neolithic individuals found in Britain, dating
              8500-2500 BC. Our analyses reveal persistent genetic affinities
              between Mesolithic British and Western European hunter-gatherers.
              We find overwhelming support for agriculture being introduced to
              Britain by incoming continental farmers, with small,
              geographically structured levels of hunter-gatherer ancestry.
              Unlike other European Neolithic populations, we detect no
              resurgence of hunter-gatherer ancestry at any time during the
              Neolithic in Britain. Genetic affinities with Iberian Neolithic
              individuals indicate that British Neolithic people were mostly
              descended from Aegean farmers who followed the Mediterranean
              route of dispersal. We also infer considerable variation in
              pigmentation levels in Europe by circa 6000 BC.",
