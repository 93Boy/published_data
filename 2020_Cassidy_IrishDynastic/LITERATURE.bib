  abstract = "The nature and distribution of political power in Europe during
              the Neolithic era remains poorly understood1. During this period,
              many societies began to invest heavily in building monuments,
              which suggests an increase in social organization. The scale and
              sophistication of megalithic architecture along the Atlantic
              seaboard, culminating in the great passage tomb complexes, is
              particularly impressive2. Although co-operative ideology has
              often been emphasised as a driver of megalith construction1, the
              human expenditure required to erect the largest monuments has led
              some researchers to emphasize hierarchy3-of which the most
              extreme case is a small elite marshalling the labour of the
              masses. Here we present evidence that a social stratum of this
              type was established during the Neolithic period in Ireland. We
              sampled 44 whole genomes, among which we identify the adult son
              of a first-degree incestuous union from remains that were
              discovered within the most elaborate recess of the Newgrange
              passage tomb. Socially sanctioned matings of this nature are very
              rare, and are documented almost exclusively among
              politico-religious elites4-specifically within polygynous and
              patrilineal royal families that are headed by god-kings5,6. We
              identify relatives of this individual within two other major
              complexes of passage tombs 150 km to the west of Newgrange, as
              well as dietary differences and fine-scale haplotypic structure
              (which is unprecedented in resolution for a prehistoric
              population) between passage tomb samples and the larger dataset,
              which together imply hierarchy. This elite emerged against a
              backdrop of rapid maritime colonization that displaced a unique
              Mesolithic isolate population, although we also detected rare
              Irish hunter-gatherer introgression within the Neolithic
              population.",
