  abstract = "The third millennium BCE was a period of major cultural and
              demographic changes in Europe that signaled the beginning of the
              Bronze Age. People from the Pontic steppe expanded westward,
              leading to the formation of the Corded Ware complex and
              transforming the genetic landscape of Europe. At the time, the
              Globular Amphora culture (3300-2700 BCE) existed over large parts
              of Central and Eastern Europe, but little is known about their
              interaction with neighboring Corded Ware groups and steppe
              societies. Here we present a detailed study of a Late Neolithic
              mass grave from southern Poland belonging to the Globular Amphora
              culture and containing the remains of 15 men, women, and
              children, all killed by blows to the head. We sequenced their
              genomes to between 1.1- and 3.9-fold coverage and performed
              kinship analyses that demonstrate that the individuals belonged
              to a large extended family. The bodies had been carefully laid
              out according to kin relationships by someone who evidently knew
              the deceased. From a population genetic viewpoint, the people
              from Koszyce are clearly distinct from neighboring Corded Ware
              groups because of their lack of steppe-related ancestry. Although
              the reason for the massacre is unknown, it is possible that it
              was connected with the expansion of Corded Ware groups, which may
              have resulted in competition for resources and violent conflict.
              Together with the archaeological evidence, these analyses provide
              an unprecedented level of insight into the kinship structure and
              social behavior of a Late Neolithic community.",
