  abstract = "During the medieval period, hundreds of thousands of Europeans
              migrated to the Near East to take part in the Crusades, and many
              of them settled in the newly established Christian states along
              the Eastern Mediterranean coast. Here, we present a genetic
              snapshot of these events and their aftermath by sequencing the
              whole genomes of 13 individuals who lived in what is today known
              as Lebanon between the 3rd and 13th centuries CE. These include
              nine individuals from the ``Crusaders' pit'' in Sidon, a mass
              burial in South Lebanon identified from the archaeology as the
              grave of Crusaders killed during a battle in the 13th century CE.
              We show that all of the Crusaders' pit individuals were males;
              some were Western Europeans from diverse origins, some were
              locals (genetically indistinguishable from present-day Lebanese),
              and two individuals were a mixture of European and Near Eastern
              ancestries, providing direct evidence that the Crusaders admixed
              with the local population. However, these mixtures appear to have
              had limited genetic consequences since signals of admixture with
              Europeans are not significant in any Lebanese group today-in
              particular, Lebanese Christians are today genetically similar to
              local people who lived during the Roman period which preceded the
              Crusades by more than four centuries.",
