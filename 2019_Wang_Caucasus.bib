  abstract = "Archaeogenetic studies have described the formation of Eurasian
              'steppe ancestry' as a mixture of Eastern and Caucasus
              hunter-gatherers. However, it remains unclear when and where this
              ancestry arose and whether it was related to a horizon of
              cultural innovations in the 4th millennium BCE that subsequently
              facilitated the advance of pastoral societies in Eurasia. Here we
              generated genome-wide SNP data from 45 prehistoric individuals
              along a 3000-year temporal transect in the North Caucasus. We
              observe a genetic separation between the groups of the Caucasus
              and those of the adjacent steppe. The northern Caucasus groups
              are genetically similar to contemporaneous populations south of
              it, suggesting human movement across the mountain range during
              the Bronze Age. The steppe groups from Yamnaya and subsequent
              pastoralist cultures show evidence for previously undetected
              farmer-related ancestry from different contact zones, while
              Steppe Maykop individuals harbour additional Upper Palaeolithic
              Siberian and Native American related ancestry.",
