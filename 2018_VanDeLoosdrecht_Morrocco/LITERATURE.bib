  abstract = "North Africa is a key region for understanding human history, but
              the genetic history of its people is largely unknown. We present
              genomic data from seven 15,000-year-old modern humans, attributed
              to the Iberomaurusian culture, from Morocco. We find a genetic
              affinity with early Holocene Near Easterners, best represented by
              Levantine Natufians, suggesting a pre-agricultural connection
              between Africa and the Near East. We do not find evidence for
              gene flow from Paleolithic Europeans to Late Pleistocene North
              Africans. The Taforalt individuals derive one-third of their
              ancestry from sub-Saharan Africans, best approximated by a
              mixture of genetic components preserved in present-day West and
              East Africans. Thus, we provide direct evidence for genetic
              interactions between modern humans across Africa and Eurasia in
              the Pleistocene.",
