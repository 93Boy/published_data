  abstract = "The Iberian Peninsula in southwestern Europe represents an
              important test case for the study of human population movements
              during prehistoric periods. During the Last Glacial Maximum
              (LGM), the peninsula formed a periglacial refugium [1] for
              hunter-gatherers (HGs) and thus served as a potential source for
              the re-peopling of northern latitudes [2]. The post-LGM genetic
              signature was previously described as a cline from Western HG
              (WHG) to Eastern HG (EHG), further shaped by later Holocene
              expansions from the Near East and the North Pontic steppes [3-9].
              Western and central Europe were dominated by ancestry associated
              with the ∼14,000-year-old individual from Villabruna, Italy,
              which had largely replaced earlier genetic ancestry, represented
              by 19,000-15,000-year-old individuals associated with the
              Magdalenian culture [2]. However, little is known about the
              genetic diversity in southern European refugia, the presence of
              distinct genetic clusters, and correspondence with geography.
              Here, we report new genome-wide data from 11 HGs and Neolithic
              individuals that highlight the late survival of Paleolithic
              ancestry in Iberia, reported previously in Magdalenian-associated
              individuals. We show that all Iberian HGs, including the oldest,
              a ∼19,000-year-old individual from El Mir{\'o}n in Spain, carry
              dual ancestry from both Villabruna and the Magdalenian-related
              individuals. Thus, our results suggest an early connection
              between two potential refugia, resulting in a genetic ancestry
              that survived in later Iberian HGs. Our new genomic data from
              Iberian Early and Middle Neolithic individuals show that the dual
              Iberian HG genomic legacy pertains in the peninsula, suggesting
              that expanding farmers mixed with local HGs. VIDEO ABSTRACT.",
