  abstract = "The indigenous populations of inner Eurasia-a huge geographic
              region covering the central Eurasian steppe and the northern
              Eurasian taiga and tundra-harbour tremendous diversity in their
              genes, cultures and languages. In this study, we report novel
              genome-wide data for 763 individuals from Armenia, Georgia,
              Kazakhstan, Moldova, Mongolia, Russia, Tajikistan, Ukraine and
              Uzbekistan. We furthermore report additional damage-reduced
              genome-wide data of two previously published individuals from the
              Eneolithic Botai culture in Kazakhstan (~5,400 BP). We find that
              present-day inner Eurasian populations are structured into three
              distinct admixture clines stretching between various western and
              eastern Eurasian ancestries, mirroring geography. The Botai and
              more recent ancient genomes from Siberia show a decrease in
              contributions from so-called 'ancient North Eurasian' ancestry
              over time, which is detectable only in the northern-most
              'forest-tundra' cline. The intermediate 'steppe-forest' cline
              descends from the Late Bronze Age steppe ancestries, while the
              'southern steppe' cline further to the south shows a strong
              West/South Asian influence. Ancient genomes suggest a northward
              spread of the southern steppe cline in Central Asia during the
              first millennium BC. Finally, the genetic structure of Caucasus
              populations highlights a role of the Caucasus Mountains as a
              barrier to gene flow and suggests a post-Neolithic gene flow into
              North Caucasus populations from the steppe.",
