  abstract = "Egypt, located on the isthmus of Africa, is an ideal region to
              study historical population dynamics due to its geographic
              location and documented interactions with ancient civilizations
              in Africa, Asia and Europe. Particularly, in the first millennium
              BCE Egypt endured foreign domination leading to growing numbers
              of foreigners living within its borders possibly contributing
              genetically to the local population. Here we present 90
              mitochondrial genomes as well as genome-wide data sets from three
              individuals obtained from Egyptian mummies. The samples recovered
              from Middle Egypt span around 1,300 years of ancient Egyptian
              history from the New Kingdom to the Roman Period. Our analyses
              reveal that ancient Egyptians shared more ancestry with Near
              Easterners than present-day Egyptians, who received additional
              sub-Saharan admixture in more recent times. This analysis
              establishes ancient Egyptian mummies as a genetic source to study
              ancient human history and offers the perspective of deciphering
              Egypt's past at a genome-wide level.",
